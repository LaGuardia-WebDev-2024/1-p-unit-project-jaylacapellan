        <h2 style="font-family:fantasy; color:rgb(78, 31, 31)">COOKIES AND BROWNIES</h2>
            <p> Cookies and brownies are like a warm hug of <strong>goey, rich goodness</strong>. Cookies come in so many different varieties that you can just never get enough. Some of those are;</p><ul>
              <li>chocolate chip</li>
              <li>sugar cookies</li>
              <li>smores cookies(not my personal fav)</li>

You can get cakey or fudgy and know that it will be good either way especially if it has the little crackles on the top.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; color:cadetblue"><strong>ICECREAM</strong></h2>
          <p>On a scorching hot, sunny day and matter of fact even on a cold, snowy day I can and will always enjoy a cup of cold, soft, refreshing icecream. You can choose to enjoy your icecream in a cup, sugar cone, or waffle cone and can even add whatever toppings you want such as candy, popping boba, fruit, syrups or whatever you want. My personal favorites are sprinkles, brownies, cookie dough, and nutella. However, I only get toppings with froyo. Some of my favorite icecream flavors are salted caramel,(hot-take) mint-chocolate chip, chocolate chip cookie dough and of course an original cookies and cream. I would honestly eat almost any icecream flavor.</p>
